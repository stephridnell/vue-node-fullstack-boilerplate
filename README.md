# Vue.js Frontend + Node.js API Fullstack Boilerplate

Front end was templated using vue-cli 2 using the webpack template and is using webpack version 3.4.1.

Includes sample implementation showing you how to fetch data from your API through the Vuex store using [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) as the HTTP client.

There is no authentication in place - all API routes are public.

npm install
npm run dev

Will automatically open in a new browser, set `autoOpenBrowser = false` in `server/dev.js` to disable this.
